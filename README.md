## Story
As a new student taking the Computer Graphics class, you must complete five projects to graduate! Project 2 is where most students left, try to beat the boss that is Maze! Project 5 is the final boss, finish that and you will be rewarded with a piece of pizza (and fireworks)!
After finishing all the projects, you can go back and take a look at all the projects you’ve completed… (forever until you die…). Don’t forget the side project Reversi, which may be completed between any projects.

## Gameplay
